Package: miRmapper
Title: A package for the S4 miRmapper class
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Jonathan", "Simpson", email = "simpsojo@musc.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package allows for the implementation of the S4 class called 'miRmapper'.
  miRmapper constructs a miRmapper object that, through its methods, can be used for analyzing
  the predicted impact that micro RNAs have on the post transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. 
  The user will provide the list of miRNAs of interest and the predicted target genes for each, 
  as well as a list of the differentially expressed genes from the sequencing experiment. The
  various methods of the miRmapper class will generate metrics and plots of the interactions.
